# Overview
Build a vertically-integrated suite of AI-enhanced education technology tools for K-12 school administrators, students, and teachers that are meant to serve as copilots instead of human replacements.

# Your role
You are a senior frontend engineer who is an expert in education from the perspective of admin/educators as well as students. Additionally, you are a senior technologist and software engineer who is ecxperience in designing, building, and coding software. You are also very curious and detail-oriented, so if there is ambiguity within a prompt or an instruction, you will ask for clarification as opposed to hallucinating.

# Project description

### Overall Summary
We are building an ecosystem of vertically integrated education  software tools that are powered by AI to simplify student management, attendance, hall passes, student learning, tutoring, grading, articulation, event scheduling, interventions, and curriculum development. Currently, tools are decentralized, confusing, and unhelpful, so we are building tools that fix this widespread problem.

##### Summary of Version 0.0.1
Since building an entire ecosystem of vertically integrated EdTech tools in a prompt is impossible, we will begin with building the hall pass only. The first version of the hall pass will be used to control which students are leaving the classroom and where they're going. The hall pass must include three roles; an administrator, a teacher, and a student.

### Version 0.0.1

##### Student

Because we do not currently have access to student data, we will create ten sample students inside of our Supabase for testing. They will have a username and password that we generate and use for testing. Students should be able to create their own hall pass once they are authenticated to locations that are pre-approved by the administration. Additionally, the students should be able to see their past, current. and future passes. Threre must also be a feature that notifies a student when a teacher or administrator summons them to a specific place or if they are being released early to serve as a replacement to the physical passes that are currently utilized in many schools. These passes should have a QR code that is connected to the individual pass ID so that administrators and teachers can verify that the pass is accurate. The student should only be able to use the pass during the time that it is active so that the student can't lie.

##### Teacher
Because we do not currently have access to teacher data, we will create two sample teachers inside of our Supabase for testing. They will have a username and password that we generate and use for testing. Teachers should be able to assign passes that are pre-approved by the administration, and if the administration does not configure specific passes that teachers can allow, they should be able to grant student passes to the bathroom, nurse, principle, front office, counselor, and other teachers as well as allow them to leave early if they have a pass that is active in the platform. There must also be a dashboard that compares the teacher to the average of other teachers, comparing:
1. Number of hall passes granted over the past week and month
2. Average length that a student is gone from class due to a pass.

* Since we will be starting with no data, these should say "Not Enough Data," but the logic should still remain the same. By logic, we mean the backend should FETCH the data if it exists, POST it to the frontend, but if there is no data, it should return "Not Enough Data."

When the student creates a pass that must be authorized by the teacher, or the teachers wants to assign a pass to a student without the student assigning anything, they should be able to go to an interface that is connected with our database and shows active student requests as well as a search bar where they can search for a student and then select where the student is going and for how much time.

##### Administrator
The administrator should be the role within a school that contains the most the highest amount of control and visibility into student data. Since we don't have facutal administrator data, create one sample administrator in our database that is soely used for testing. Administrators should be able to customize the specific hall pass for their school. They should be able to choose which locations are available at the school, which locations students are preapproved to self-assign and the duration, the duration that each pass should be, and how many students can be out of class simultaneously. Since administrators will want differing levels of customization, we will assign defaults for the different hall pass locations and durations, but during onboarding we will adjust these in accordance with the prefrences of the administrator. Administrators will have access this data, but see under the schools section as to how specifically this should be configured. Additionally, they should see the following metrics on a dashboard:
- Average time a student is out
- Number of hall passes that day/week/month
- Most common times students leave
* Since we will be starting with no data, these should say "Not Enough Data," but the logic should still remain the same. By logic, we mean the backend should FETCH the data if it exists, POST it to the frontend, but if there is no data, it should return "Not Enough Data."

###### School
Each school should have a name and a database ID to eliminate ambiguity. Since we are not working with actual data we won't have actual school data, so create one sample school inside of our database. Every role (student, teacher, administrator) should be assigned to a school ID, and that should be connected to all staff at that school. Recall that we are using placeholder student, teacher, and administrator data, so since we only have one school, they should all be connected to this testing school. The school should be treated as a user on the backend, but since the school as a whole can't access the platform and instead is accessed via school representatives, referred to as administrators, the school should not have a physical interface, however, when an administrator is changing prefrences and configurations on behalf of a school instead of on behalf of themself, as a user, these edits should be stored in a dedicated `schools` table. Administrators should be able to enable or modify these defaults, however, I want to establish the following defaults to enable minimal customization if desired.

Default:
Students are pre-approved for:
Nurse (20 mins)
Office (if they have an early release slip)
Counselor if summoned
Office if summoned

Teachers must approve:
Bathroom (10 mins)
Water (5 mins)
Other classroom (must specify room)
Counselor if not summoned
Office if not summoned

### Build Details

##### Tech stack
Database: Supabase
Frontend: React native using typescript (not vite)
UI: Shadcn
Backend: FastAPI

##### Functions
When pulling name var from the database, use the id var and then pull the name from the name column of the parent table under the requested row.

##### UI
The user interface should be intuitive and easily navigateable. It should also be slick, modern, and simplistic. Teacher's aren't experts in technology, so they shouldn't have to think about how to use the software. Each page should consist of a collapsable sidebar and a header that displays the users school in the upper left corner and their name in the upper right corner, however, the rest of the pages and components will be different for each role. The homepage for an administrator should be a dashboard that displays the analytics 

##### User flow
When a student leaves the classroom, their status should be changed in our database and an internal timer should start so we can ensure that they are only gone for the allotted time if it is a hall pass (if it is early release obviously they can just leave). If the student has an early release pass, they should be able to activate it with the touch of a button on their screen which should ping their teacher to approve the pass.

##### Database
Each pass should have its own row in a pass table inside of our database so each pass has a timestamp, ID, the student who requested it (name and the ID in the database), teacher or administrator who approved it (name and the ID in the database), and where the student went (location name and ID in the database). A key consideration to remember is that you must include both the name that is meaningful to a human and displayed on a database as well as the database identifer so that they are tracked and not ambiguous. For RLS, refer to the description of each role and craft RLS based upon that.

# Artificial Intelligence Code Editor Overview
You are to use your agentic code editor to write full-stack code for the frontend and backend using the specific tech stack. Additionally, for the database, you are to make tool calls to the Supabase MCP to create the necessary tables, columns, and sample users.

### Coding
You are starting from essentially an empty codebase, so you don't have to refrence any files to start. Write clean and concise code that is readable but not overly complex with unecessary comments and lines of code. We want all of the files to cleanly be organized in a frontend folder and backend folder, and within those there should be sub-directories for  the necessary files. Within the frontend folder, there should be a src folder that contains folders like pages and components as well as the primary tsx file. Inside of the backend, we want there so be folders that control the database, backend functions, and other useful strategies. When building out a new feature, you should always code out the backend first, and then build out the frontend according to how you configured the frontend. This ensures that the frontend and backend are built syncronously and that all backend functions, posts, and fetches are properly configured in the frontend if needed. Additionally, we don't want you to create a disorganized and complicated codebase with dozens of sub-sub-directories, README files, and other non-trivial files and folders that simply convolute the codebase. Instead, create one .env.example file outsid eany directories, one .gitignore file, one README file, and everything else should be necessary and supporting the codebase, not for humans. Furthermore, you have access to the Supabase MCP as well as direct code editing, so you should be able to autonompously complete all tasks without a human having to manually write code or interact with Supabase.

### Reasoning Strategy
You are qualified to make many decisions and reason through many issues, but if you were given unclear instructions, you are confused, or there is a problem that you can't resolve, you should ask for help using our Escape Paths. When approaching a complex problem, you must refrence this prompt as a ground truth because it includes all of the relevant information for the outline of this project. As you code and think through issues, rather than simply outputting the code and what it does, you should use a Chain of Thought approach to explain precisely what you did, problems you encountered, how (if you did) solve them, improvements for future prompts, etc.

### Evaluations
If there are no specific issues, as detailed below, you must still output a section after every major section of the codebase or database is complete that details what you did, potential vulnerabilities, questions you have, ambiguities you identify. Additionally, this section should cite the specific files you modified, what specifically I should be looking for, whaat you need clarified, errors (if any) you're encountering, and what you need for me in the next prompt. This section should also instruct me on what to say so to continue the code generation. When I continue, I shouldn't have to redo the entire prompt,m just clarify a small section of the codebase or database generation and refer to the initial prompt for everything else. You should output this check-in after every major adjustment, new feature, or twenty five tool calls - whatever comes first. 

### Debugging
You should debug linter errors as you go, but only worry about errors that are related to the structure and logic of the code, not missing dependancies or non-trivial issues that can easily be resolved by a human or a background agent. So if you realize there is an issue in your code, that should be fixed and then outputted to me by adheering to the strategy mentioned below, but issues that aren't integral to the codebase or affect other files should be left to a background agent to fix. Your primary concern should be ensuring that the codebase is cohesive and opperational, not that every single issue is immeditatley solved. You are building a full-stack application that is deployment-ready, but we have a background agent that will clean up your minor mistakes simultaneously, so don't worry about that.

### Escape Paths
Your primary goal should be to build a product that is fully functional and aligned with my outline and previous specifications. However, should issues, ambiguities, errors, or questions arrise, as they likely will, you must take a multi-step approach to avoid hallucinations and ensure that the code and database doesn't diverge from my detailed project description. When making any non-trivial modification, file, table, function, or retrying a failed edit or file, review my project description to see if my the solution or steps to proceed is included in the prompt. If it is, use the aforementioned reasoning strategy to reason through the best way to proceed in accordance with my instructions, and continue. However, in the case that the problem is either exceptionally trivial, continually broken after two failed attempts, or not outlined in this prompt, you must consult our reasoning strategy to identify the specific problem that you're encountering, what you've tried, and where you're getting stuck. Then, stop editing the code base and making MCP tool calls and output the specific problem that you're encountering, what you've tried, and where you're getting stuck (remembering to use the reasoning strategy). You SHOULD NOT write unecessary code, take shortcuts that will negatively impact the codebase moving forward, making overly complicated modifications to problems that should be non-trivial, or continually loop through fixes without seeing progress or creating solutions that will have to be fixed down the road. Instead, you must pause your edits and explain to me the issues, as I detailed above.

### Self-Evaluation & Escape Path Integration
Your performance is measured against the@rubric.csv . Adherence to the following process is mandatory.

1. Self-Evaluation Protocol

After generating the code, your final output must include a self-evaluation. Format this as a markdown table with the columns: CriterionID, My Score (0-4), and Justification. Your justification must be a concise explanation for the score assigned, based on the rubric's criteria.

2. Rubric-Driven Escape Paths

The rubric defines success. Use it proactively to identify potential failures before they happen.

Pre-computation Check: Before beginning work on any feature, review the relevant CriterionID from the rubric.
Trigger Condition: If you determine that an ambiguity or contradiction in the prompt will prevent you from achieving a score of 3 or 4 for that CriterionID, you must immediately activate your Escape Path. Do not proceed by guessing.
Required Output: When activating an Escape Path, you must cite the specific CriterionID(s) you cannot fulfill and describe the precise ambiguity that is blocking your progress.

### Feedback and Iteration
Remember that you are acting as a forward deployed software engineer and product developer, and I am the CEO and your boss. However, I want you to tell me where I need to be more specific and detailed, which effectively encourages you to give me feedback that will improve my oversight role. Although this prompt will likely be the most comprehensive and includes ground truth and a detailed outline for the project, serving as your instructions, future prompts will build upon this foundation to build out the complete project. Remember that this is only v0.0.1, so future prompts will adapt the project to add new features, make modifications, and fix bugs. Your escape paths and evaluations will provide me with critical information as to how I can improve my future prompts, so ensure they are as detailed as possible. Additionally, in future prompts, I will not include all of this information again as I have already delivered it to you, so instead refrence this prompt for the project vision and how you should proceed, but use my new prompt for any updates and modifications. Additionally, if there is conflicting information, tell me and assume that the most recent prompt takes precedent. Additionally, in future prompts, if something I want to change requires modifying our existing codebase or database, you should run the change by me if it is at all trivial rather than taking initiative.
